## Welcome to your new blog built with Next.js.

After you cloned the repository make sure you have installed [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) and [now-cli](https://github.com/zeit/now-cli).

Then, `cd` into the repository folder and install the dependencies.

```bash
$ cd nextjs-blog-starter
$ yarn install
```

Then, check your new blog in your local development environment.

```bash
$ now dev
```

If everything went well, you&rsquo;ll see your blog at http://localhost:300 (unless you specified a different port).

You&rsquo;ll find this post in your `page/posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and see the changes appear instantly in your screen.

To add new posts, simply add a MDX file in the `page/posts` directory, press `ctrl + c` to stop the development server and run `now dev` again.

After you personalize your blog you can deploy it to Now.

```bash
$ now
```

Then, you will see your blog online in a URL like https://nextjs-blog-starter.now.sh
