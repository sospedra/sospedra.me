In the past years, GitHub became a technology mastodon. Since the [acquisition by Microsoft](https://news.microsoft.com/2018/06/04/microsoft-to-acquire-github-for-7-5-billion/), the company added a myriad of outstanding features. [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions), in-house CI/CD, a marketplace, the [integration of npm](https://github.blog/2020-03-16-npm-is-joining-github/), et al. In fact, **GitHub is so powerful nowadays that it can be your all-in-all provider**. You can use **GitHub as a Service**. GaaS, Gaas, Gaas!

## What is GaaS?

GitHub's variety of products is extensive enough to power most of the web apps out there. Don't believe me? Let's go through my journey building [Request For Maintainers](https://rfm.sospedra.me/) (RFM).

This project is a community-driven platform to track any repository calling for support. From the product point of view, I want to help the community to have a clean record of the OSS status. On the tech side, this project is an experiment I got in my mind for so long. **RFM runs 100% on GitHub services**. And it's [open-sourced](https://github.com/sospedra/rfm) so anyone is welcome to check the nuts and bolts.

If you want to build a web app that runs on GitHub you're gonna need some foundations. Basic things that are common to any web. But, before getting started, a disclaimer. I didn't read the terms and conditions and all the legal dullness. But I can sense this approach ~~maybe~~ exceeds the intended purposes.

- **Hosting**: for what **GitHub repositories** excel. But wait, there's more! [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) put your web under a CDN, with SSL certs, and all the other goodies you'll expect from your trusted provider.

- **Database**: if you don't have anything to hide üåù then **GitHub Issues is a wonderful database**. For example, you can store a stringified JSON in the body. Or benefit from the Issue metadata.

- **Server**: most of the heavy lifting will happen in the client. But sometimes you need some special functions to run on the cloud. Did anyone say **serverless**? üíä

- **Auth**: Do you need to put some access restrictions? Well, GitHub has a top-notch [OAuth service](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/) implemented.

- **Secrets**: Another interesting side-effect is the **env secrets management**. Since GitHub repositories already have a secret values system. We can use that to run out GitHub Actions as serverless functions.

> Let's say you have a **basic ecommerce** of only 3 digital products.
> Create a **repository**. Put your **product data as issues**. Code and deploy the static **website**.
>
> Add some **basic authentication** and finally run the **payment confirmation as a GitHub Action**.
>
> You can store confirmation tokens in another private repo since **secrets are well kept in GitHub**.

## How does it work?

At this point, I guess you get the idea. But how we put together all the pieces? Let's see how I built RFM step by step. You'll see it's not that complex at all.

1. You need your web to be **statically generated**. There are tones of options: `Jekyll`, `create-react-app`, an old-fashion raw `HTML`. Whatever. The important bit is that to use GitHub pages it must be **static**.

2. You consume your fancy database with the public [GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/v3/). The public part is a no key-required standard CRUD. Your web app will **use this API to get GitHub Issues**. You can tweak your query with multiple params: the state, labels, content, assignation, etc.

```js
// request first 13 RFM open requests that matches "vapor"
const params = [
  'repo:sospedra/rfm',
  'state:open',
  'label:search',
  'vapor',
  'in:title,body'
]
const root = 'https://api.github.com/search/issues'
const path = `${root}?q=${params.join('+')}&per_page=13`
const response = await fetch(path)
const payload: {
  items: Items,
  total_count: number
} = await response.json()
const items = payload.items.map<Request>((item) => {
  // using the body as JSON with RFM data model
  body: JSON.parse(item.body),
  // benefit from the Issue metadata as well
  createdAt: new Date(item.created_at),
  title: item.title,
})
```

3. When in need of **server functions use GitHub Actions**. These deliver an outstanding experience. They are so powerful. The basic idea is that a custom trigger will execute a custom function. There's a [marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace) you can explore or [you can build your own](https://help.github.com/en/actions/building-actions). It's free real state!

```yml
// rfm/.github/workflows/issue.yml
name: Create external issues
on:
  # run when modify issue label
  issues:
    types: [labeled]

jobs:
  create:
    # filter only those issues with the label "search"
    if: "contains(github.event.issue.labels.*.name, 'search')"
    name: Create issue
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # parse the body of the issue
      - name: vars
        id: vars
        uses: gr2m/get-json-paths-action@v1.x
      # create a new issue in the repo that needs support
      - name: create-issue
        # notice that logic operators are available
        if: steps.vars.outputs.requestIssueFullName == 'NONE'
        uses: maxkomarychev/oction-create-issue@v0.7.1
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.RFM_BOT }}
          title: üöß Is this repo looking for support?
          owner: ${{ steps.vars.outputs.owner }}
          repo: ${{ steps.vars.outputs.name }}
          body: Heeenlo hoomans!
```

4. To integrate RFM with GitHub I use the [GitHub Query Parameters](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-automation-for-issues-and-pull-requests-with-query-parameters). You know, remember to avoid *Hooman Paws*‚Ñ¢Ô∏è as much as possible. There's a well-known library that can do the heavy parsing for us: [new-github-issue-url](https://github.com/sindresorhus/new-github-issue-url).

```js
const createGithubIssue = (request?: SubmitRequest) => {
  if (!request) return ''
  return newGithubIssueUrl({
    body: JSON.stringify(request, null, 4),
    labels: ['search'],
    repo: 'rfm',
    title: request.fullName,
    user: 'sospedra',
  })
}
```

5. Finally, tweak the limitations. You can either add some auth with the GitHub OAuth. Or play with the Issues metadata, Actions triggers, etc. In RFM the actions are **executed only when the issue has a particular label**. Only moderators can assign labels. That's the way I avoid RFM being a spammy tool.

## Conclusion

Am I suggesting that y'all should use **GaaS** from now on? Well, absolutely no ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. But, there are some cases where this can be beneficial. I'm thinking of OSS projects, mostly. In fact, using [GitHub Issues as blog post comments](https://utteranc.es/) it's being a common practice for a long time. This is an evolution of the same concept. The actual point is: **GitHub become an infra beast** lately. We should keep an eye here and consider pushing the limits as much as possible.
